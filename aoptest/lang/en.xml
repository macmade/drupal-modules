        <description>Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) is a programming paradigm which complements Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) by separating concerns of a software application to improve modularization. The separation of concerns (SoC) aims for making a software easier to maintain by grouping features and behaviour into manageable parts which all have a specific purpose and business to take care of.</description>
